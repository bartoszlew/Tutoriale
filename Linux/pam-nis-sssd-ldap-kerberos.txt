The sssd daemon acts as the spider in the web, controlling the login process and more. The login program communicates with the 
configured pam and nss modules, which in this case are provided by the SSSD package. These modules communicate with the corresponding SSSD responders, 
which in turn talk to the SSSD Monitor. SSSD looks up the user in the LDAP directory, then contacts the Kerberos KDC for authentication and to aquire tickets.

NIS:
The Name Service Switch (NSS) is a facility in Unix-like operating systems that provides a variety of sources for common configuration databases
and name resolution mechanisms. These sources include local operating system files (such as /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/hosts), the Domain Name System (DNS), 
the Network Information Service (NIS), and LDAP.

# sssd automatically modifies the PAM files with pam-auth-update and /etc/nsswitch.conf, so all that's left is to configure /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
